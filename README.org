* PKGBUILDs of PS4 4.14-latest
Title explains all. Also installs linux-git-headers, DKMS should work, I tested it with v4l2loopbak-dkms and it worked. Based on vanilla linux-git PKGBUILD from the AUR.

** Installing
clone this repo and run =makepkg --skipinteg -si=
Then copy /boot/vmlinuz-linux-git to your PS4's fat32 boot drive as bzImage.
*** Eg:
If /mnt was my fat32 partition, then
=# mv /mnt/bzImage /mnt/bzImage.bak=
=# cp /boot/vmlinuz-linux-git /mnt/bzImage=

** TODO
*TODO*
- Make a script that generates an sha sum and inserts it into the PKGBUILD so =--skipinteg= is no longer needed (and for security :P)
